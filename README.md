# Hekili JoshEdit

All credit goes to [Hekili](https://github.com/Hekili/hekili). This is a custom version suited to my purposes.

Over time, this project may venture very differently from Hekili. If you are looking for the latest official version of Hekili, please visit the [Latest Release](https://github.com/Hekili/hekili/releases/latest).

## About This Version

I am releasing a publicly available, open-source version of my Hekili cut. This version is **not** designed to troll or replace Hekili; it is simply an alternative approach that does things a bit differently. Future updates will focus on:

- Supporting retail WoW exclusively.
- Removing certain features (e.g., Spellflash) to reduce code and minimize bloat.
- Updating libraries to enhance compatibility with modern WoW APIs.
- Customizing for the Hekili branch.

## Motivation

Why am I doing this?  
Hekili and Syrif haven't embraced my suggestions and ideas, perhaps because I'm not a professional coder (and I do use some AI assistance). I plan to support mainly the specs I play or those used by friends. This project is not meant to replace Hekili's original versionâ€”if you prefer the original, stick with it. However, if you find this version better suited to your needs, then that's great!

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests with improvements or bug fixes.

## Acknowledgements

A big thank you to the Hekili team for their hard work and inspiration.
